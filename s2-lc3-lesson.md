# Week 2





## Conventions

### General




* <> for SPELLING

* // for phonological transcriptions (or broad transcriptions)

* [] for phonetic transcriptions (or narrow transcriptions)










* < taste > 

* /\textipa{teIst}/ 

* \textipa{[t\super heIst]} 






### For stress patterns:

* One digit per syllable

* "0", "1", "2" according to the stress (none, primary, secondary).



## Absolute MUST-KNOW

**\color[HTML]{f44336}FUNDAMENTAL RULES \color{black}** (no exceptions!!): 


* /00/ impossible at the beginning of a word
  - But possible anywhere else, *cf.* "appreciatively".

* All words have a **unique** primary stress



### For rules:

* "V" stands for "vowel" (not to confuse with: "v"=< v >)

* "C" stands for consonant

* "()" means the symbol between brackets is optional

* "#" means the end of the word

* A number indicates the number of occurrences of the symbol

* "-" excludes the following letter

* "{}" indicates a selection of possibilities




## Example 1

* V C^-r^ C/## ...




\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
 & V C-r C/\# & V C-r V & V <r> C/\# & V <r> V\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<a>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{mat} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{mate} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{mar} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{mare}\\
<e> & pet & Pete & her & here\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<i>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{sit} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{site} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{fir} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{fire}\\
<o> & not & note & or & ore\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<u>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{cut} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{cute} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{purr} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{pure}\\
\addlinespace
<u2> & put &  &  & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



Can you formulate the rules for each column?

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<a>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{m\ae t}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{meIt}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{mA:}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{me@}/}\\
<e> & /\textipa{pet}/ & /\textipa{pi:t}/ & /\textipa{h3:}/ & /\textipa{hI@}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<i>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{sIt}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{saIt}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{f3:}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"faI.@}/}\\
<o> & /\textipa{n6t}/ & /\textipa{n@Ut}/ & /\textipa{O:}/ & /\textipa{O:}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{<u>} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{k2t}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{kju:t}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{p3:}/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{pjU@}/}\\
\addlinespace
<u2> & /\textipa{pUt}/ &  &  & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

What vowels are not present in this chart?






* \textipa{@} 
 





* \textipa{OI} 

* \textipa{aU} 






### Reminders:

#### There are two categories of vowels:



* Checked / lax / short vowels





* Free / tense / long vowels
  - monophthongs
  - diphthongs






#### /\textipa{@}/, /i/ and /u/ only in unstressed syllables






## Example 2

### Exercise 1


Listen to the following words. Give their stress patterns, and transcribe them if you can:


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{canadian} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/0100/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{k@."neId.i.@n}/}\\
comedian & /0100/ & /\textipa{k@."mi:d.i.@n}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{magician} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/010/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{m@."dZIS.@n}/}\\
custodian & /0100/ & /\textipa{k2."st@Ud.i.@n}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{venusian} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/0100/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{v@."nju:z.i.@n}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

### Correction 1

The stress pattern in all these words was...

/010/


Can you formulate the rule?


<-ian> is a stress-imposing suffix: the preceding syllable must carry the primary stress.



It is an extension of the infamous <-ion> rule, so we can formalize:

"The syllable preceding the suffix <-i {a,o} n> carries the primary stress.



## Exercise 2

* What words were these adjectives derived from?

* Comment on the stress pattern of these words.

* Comment on the vocalic realizations of these words.


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{canada} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/100/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"k\ae n.@d.@}/}\\
comedy & /100/ & /\textipa{"k6m.@d.i}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{magic} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/10/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"m\ae dZ.Ik}/}\\
custody & /100/ & /\textipa{"k2st.@d.i}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{venus} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/10/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"vi:n.@s}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}




 Look at the quality of the vowels in the stressed syllables. 



## Homework

 Which are regular? Which aren't? What process is happening?
